# Primitivo

Small Java utility library of iterators and mutable wrappers for the primitive types.

The only dependency of the library is JDK 1.5+.

Because the language level is set to 1.5 (which it is because no newer features are being used),
the project doesn't build on JDK 1.9+.
A simple workaround is to set language level 1.6 or newer in `pom.xml`.
